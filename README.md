# League Dialog

A custom dialog element `<league-dialog>` that works with `<details>` allowing it to be used without JavaScript, providing progressive enhancement.

This is is inspired by the [GitHub details-dialog](https://github.com/github/details-dialog-element) custom element. This element differs in that it is easier to customize / extend, and also dependant on LitElement.

The element can either:

- be placed in an a `<details>` element as the content, that acts as the button
- exist on its own, in which case it will wrap itself in a `<details>`, needed for styling

## Example

Normally, placed in a `<details>`, which allows it to work without JavaScript:

```html preview-story
<details>
  <summary class="button">Open Details Dialog</summary>
  <league-dialog aria-label="Sample Dialog">
    <header slot="header">Header</header>
    <section>
      <form action=".">
        <label>Name <input /></label>
      </form>
    </section>
    <footer slot="footer">
      <button class="button" cancel>Cancel</button>
    </footer>
  </league-dialog>
</details>
```

Or on its own, the `show(invoker)` method is called by JavaScript:

```html preview-story
<button class="button" onclick="document.querySelector('#dialog').show(this)">
  Open Stand Alone Dialog
</button>
<league-dialog aria-label="Sample Dialog" id="dialog">
  <header slot="header">Header</header>
  <section>
    <form action=".">
      <label>Name <input /></label>
    </form>
  </section>
  <footer slot="footer">
    <button class="button" cancel>Cancel</button>
  </footer>
</league-dialog>
```

## Interaction Notes

- Uses the details-dialog pattern
  - Works without javascript given proper styling
- Follows the [League UI Guide for Dialogs](https://github.com/componentleague/ui-guides/blob/main/dialogs.md) as much as it can while still being lightweight, and modular
  - Does not allow closing when clicking outside of the dialog
  - Focuses the first element with the "autofocus" attribute, or failing that the first focusable element
  - Traps tabbing so only elements within it are selected via tab
  - Focus returns to the "invoker" element, which is by default the `<summary>` element of the details around it
  - Enforces proper A11y needs, role "dialog", label, etc.
- Adds a "dialog-open" attribute to the body when open â€” useful for styling.

## Api

#### Properties

`open` Gets or sets whether the dialog is open. This will bypass all event checks.

#### Methods

`show(invoker)` Show the dialog. `invoker` is the element that will recieve focus when the dialog is closed.

`close()` Close the dialog, can be canceled by using `preventDefault()` on the 'close' event, as seen below.

#### Events

`open` is triggered when opened

`close` is triggered when the `close()` method is called. It is cancelable, so `e => e.preventDefault()` will stop it from being closed.

## Styling

Because everything stays in the Light DOM, styling must be provided by the end developer. At a minimum, you'll want something like this to show a backdrop and the dialog:

```css
details.with-dialog > league-dialog {
  position: fixed;
  margin: 10vh auto;
  top: 0;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translateX(-50%);
  z-index: 999;
  max-height: 80vh;
  max-width: 90vw;
  width: 448px;
  background-color: white;
  border-radius: 4px;
  box-shadow: 0 3px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16), 0 3px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.23);
}

details.with-dialog[open] > summary:before {
  content: " ";
  background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
  display: block;
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
  left: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  z-index: 1;
}
```

#### Body Styling

When the dialog is open, an "dialog-open" attribute is added to the body for styling purposes.

## Extending

There are two ways to extend it, one is to simply extend it as normal `class MyDialog extends LeagueDialog { ... }`. This
works great, but sometimes you might want to also extend some other base element.

Another way is to wrap it. Create a custom element that renders the `league-dialog` in the Light DOM. The trade-off is that JavaScript is necessary, but that's already needed if extending another element.

For example:

```js
class MyDialog extends LitElement {
  createRenderRoot() {
    return this;
  }

  renderContent() {
    return html`...`;
  }

  render() {
    return html`
      <details>
        <summary class="button">Open Dialog</summary>
        <league-dialog>
          <header slot="header">Dialog Title</header>
          <section>${this.renderContent()}</section>
          <footer slot="footer"><button class="button" cancel>Cancel</button></footer>
      </details>
    `;
  }
}

customElement.define("my-dialog", MyDialog);
```

Now we can use it simply with:

```html
<my-dialog></my-dialog>
```
